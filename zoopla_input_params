property_listings, property_agents, and zoopla_estimates are the only methods to support lat_min, lat_max, lon_min and lon_max.

Parameter name	Description

area - Arbitrary area name, or postcode.
street - Name of street to locate.
town - Name of a town to locate.
postcode - Full or partial postcode.
county - The name of a county.
country - The name of a country.
latitude - Exact latitude of a location, must be used in conjunction with longitude and will take priority over other
           parameters specified. Valid values are in the interval [-90,90].
longitude - Exact longitude of a location. Valid values are in the interval [-180,180].
lat_min - Lower bound of a latitude range, must be used in conjunction with lat_max, lon_min and lon_max. Valid values
          are in the interval [-90,90].
lat_max - Upper bound of a latitude range, must be used in conjunction with lat_min, lon_min and lon_max. Valid values
          are in the interval [-90,90].
lon_min - Lower bound of a longitude range, must be used in conjunction with lat_min, lat_max and lon_max. Valid values
          are in the interval [-180,180].
lon_max - Upper bound of a longitude range, must be used in conjunction with lat_min, lat_max and lon_min. Valid values
          are in the interval [-180,180].
output_type - The actual area type to restrict the location request to - postcode, outcode, street, town, area or county.
              For instance, specifying a value for "postcode" (or a postcode within the "area" parameter) above and then
              a value of "town" for this parameter will use the town that the postcode is within, not the postcode
              itself. Note that the same occurs for latitude/longitude searches; providing an exact location with an
              output type of "postcode" will use the postcode during the request, not the latitude/longitude provided.
